# SnowSeeker
An app to let users browse ski resorts around the world, to help them find one suitable for their next holiday

There is a JSON file with all the data in the app bundle. After the decoding process, the resorts are shown in the main view as a list.
You can see details about resorts by clicking on them. In the detail view, you can mark a resort as a favorite.
When a resort is marked as a favorite, in the main view, the app shows a heart icon.

There are some neutral views that change based on sizeClass and DynamicTypeSize
